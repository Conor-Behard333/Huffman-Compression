How to use the program:
Compress:
To compress a file, click on the compress button given when the program first runs.

Then click the 'select txt file' button. This will allow you to choose the text file
that you want to compress.

Next click the 'select output directory' button. This will allow you to choose
where you want the compressed file to be written to. The initial directory shown when you
click the button is the directory of the text file that you chose to compress.

Then click compress. If everything goes right then a message will be displayed showing where the
file was outputted to (the directory you chose). If there is an error, you will be shown an
error message.

You can use the 'back' button to go back to the options to either compress or uncompress.

Uncompress:
The method is the same to uncompress a file just make sure that the file you select is the compressed version of the file.
